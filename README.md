# waterbits-chatbot

In this repo, i will build a chatbot in Dialogflow for WaterBits.
It will be an end-to-end project covering Dialogflow basics, building a backend in python and Fastapi, interactions with MySQL database, and much more.
I include Dialogflow fundamentals such as intents, entities, contexts, etc in this project.
