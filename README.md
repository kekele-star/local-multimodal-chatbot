# Local Multimodal AI Chat: local-multimodal-chatbots-chatbot

Local Multimodal AI Chat is a practical project aimed at developing a versatile chatbot platform capable of integrating various AI models for handling text, voice, and image inputs within a single interface. This project serves as a foundational exploration into AI-driven solutions tailored for local communities, with a specific focus on enhancing the functionality and engagement of the local-multimodal-chatbots project.

#Project Purpose
The primary goal of this endeavor is to use the Local Multimodal AI Chat project to test hypotheses related to enhancing user interactions. I also decided to build this chatbot to test out a project my friends and i are working on which focuses on addressing Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDG 6) â€“ clean water and sanitation. My aim with this chatbot project is to experiment with advanced AI capabilities and their potential impact on SDG 6.

# Getting Started
To get started with the Local Multimodal AI Chat for local-multimodal-chatbots, follow these steps:
### 1. Clone the repository: I am using Python 3.12 currently
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <water-bits>
cd local-multimodal-chatbots
```

### 2. Install Poetry ( i am using poetry instead of pip)

Make sure you have Poetry installed. If not, you can install it via pip or pipx:
```bash
pip install poetry
```

### 3. Install dependencies
Use Poetry to install the project dependencies and set up the virtual environment:

```bash
poetry install
```

This command installs all necessary dependencies specified in `pyproject.toml`.

### 4. Activate the virtual environment
```bash
poetry shell
```

Activating the virtual environment ensures that all subsequent commands run within the project's isolated environment.

## Usage

Once you've set up the environment, you can start the Local Multimodal AI Chat application:

```bash
poetry run python app.py
```

Replace `app.py` with the actual entry point of your application if different.
