**Scope of Work (SOW) for Water Quality Chatbot Development**

**Project Title:** Water Quality Assurance Chatbot

**Project Overview:**
The Water Quality Assurance Chatbot will provide real-time information and support to rural communities regarding water quality. The chatbot will leverage advanced technology to predict and ensure the safety of water, assist users in understanding water quality data, and promote sustainable water management practices.

**Objectives:**
1. To develop a user-friendly chatbot that provides accurate water quality information.
2. To integrate the chatbot with a web application for real-time water quality assessments.
3. To educate users about water quality issues and promote sustainable water practices.

**Scope of Work:**

1. **Project Initiation:**
   - Define project goals and objectives.
   - Identify key stakeholders.
   - Develop a project plan with timelines and milestones.

   - Integrate the chatbot with the existing web application.
   - Implement features to assess key water quality factors (e.g., pH levels, conductivity, oxygen content).

4. **Data Integration:**
   - Integrate the dataset of nearly 1900 water samples into the chatbot.
   - Ensure the chatbot can access and process real-time water quality data.
   - Implement data normalization and WQI calculation.

5. **Testing and Quality Assurance:**
   - Perform unit testing, integration testing, and system testing.
   - Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) with stakeholders.
   - Fix any identified bugs and improve chatbot performance.

6. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy the chatbot on the designated web platform.
   - Ensure the chatbot is accessible to the target rural communities.
   - Provide user training and support materials.

7. **Maintenance and Support:**
   - Offer ongoing technical support and maintenance.
   - Monitor chatbot performance and user feedback.
   - Implement updates and improvements based on user feedback and evolving needs.

8. **Project Management:**
   - Regular project status updates to stakeholders.
   - Risk management and mitigation planning.
   - Ensure project deliverables are met on time and within budget.

**Deliverables:**
